## Duan Shuxi's Personal Website

### Self Description
I am currently a graduated student in Nanjing University majoring in Economics. I build this website to share my analyses and opinions mainly on economic issues. Maybe ocasionally, I will upload something on my personal stuff. In this perspective, this webpage serves as a blog. Here are some tags of me out of my self portrait. ***Economic researcher***, ***Tennis funs***, ***ACG lover***, ***Doggy friends***. My life motto is ***古之立大事者，不惟有超世之才，亦必有坚忍不拔之志***, which means that Since ancient times, those who established great things were not only talented in the world, but also had the will to persevere. This motto comes from one of my favorite poets, Su Shi in Song Dynasty. The essay is available at [晁错论](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E6%99%81%E9%8C%AF%E8%AB%96/10172496).
